# tuple data structure
# tuple can store any data type
# most important tuples are immutable, once touple is created you can't update
# data inside tuple
# no append, no insert, no pop, no remove

example=('one','two','three')
# when we don't need to change data we use tuples.
# tuples are faster
# Methods: count, index
# len function
# slicing
print(example[:2])
